# Talking-Face-Generation-with-GANs
This is the repository of our course project (COMP 441 - Ko√ß University) on Talking-Face-Generation-with-GANs

We did 14 experiments which we could not share all of the results in the paper due to page limit. We listed all experiments with details, you can also see one example from all of the experiments and experimental results below.

Experiments:
- Experiment 1: Frame Disc. + Sequence Disc.
- Experiment 2: Frame Disc. + Sequence Disc. + Reconstruction Loss with Low Multiplier
- Experiment 3: Frame Disc. + Sequence Disc. + Reconstruction Loss with High Multiplier
- Experiment 4: Frame Disc. + Sequence Disc. + Reconstruction Loss with Low Multiplier + Pose Information Loss
- Experiment 5: Frame Disc. + Sequence Disc. + Reconstruction Loss with High Multiplier + Pose Information Loss
- Experiment 6: All Discriminators + Reconstruction Loss
- Experiment 7: All Discriminators + Pose Information Loss
- Experiment 8: All Discriminators + Pose Information Loss + Emotion Loss
- Experiment 9: All Discriminators + Reconstruction Loss + Emotion Loss
- Experiment 10: Full Model
- Experiment 11: All Discriminators + Pose Information Loss + Reconstruction Loss + Wasserstein GAN Loss
- Experiment 12: All Discriminators + Emotion Loss + Reconstruction Loss + Wasserstein GAN Loss
- Experiment 13: All Discriminators + Pose Information Loss + Emotion Loss + Wasserstein GAN Loss
- Experiment 14: Full Model + Wasserstein GAN Loss
